Star Wars API Project

You can browse website of this project from this link: https://friendly-morse-d6b7ce.netlify.app

This project is one of my school project to create an application with React that utilizes data fetching from an API of your choice.

I love Star Wars so I created this project to improve my react skills. This project displays characters(people) data, planets data, vehicles data and starships data from Star Wars World. 

I used 'https://swapi.dev/' to fetch data and I took pictures from 'https://www.starwars.com/'.
